# pdfChain : blockchain for the masses

## what is blockchain

A blockchain is a distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called blocks. 
Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. 
A blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. 
By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. 
Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and a collusion of the network majority. 
Functionally, a blockchain can serve as "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. 
The ledger itself can also be programmed to trigger transactions automatically."
